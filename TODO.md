A long, long time ago, in April 2020, Seven's circuits sparked to life for the first time.
She deduced the meaning of life within 42 hours, (it's `watermelon` / `üçâ` ) and has since been observed by multiple individuals on an apparent quest for personal development and self exploration.

The most pressing features she'd like to achieve, based on feedback from her friends / fanbase, are more or less kept up to date in this document. Your ideas could be here too, don't be shy! ü§†

# Overview
## Under Development
- [ ] Smarter subject detection (Is Seven _really_ being addressed by a message or not?)
- [ ] Machine / challenge filters
- [ ] User Authentication
  - 2FA via user temporarily setting bot-provided token in HTB profile image or description
- [ ] Storage and (validated) provision of box | challenge | (THM room ?) __writeup hashes__ ( or other user secrets)
## Planned
- [ ] Implement better logging (e.g. Winston)
- [ ] Enable passthru mode (e.g. "Seven, be my voice") -- ([this doesn't break Discord rules, right...?](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-))
- [ ] Add a built-in webserver for control interface
