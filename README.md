## About 
Seven is a semi-intelligent AI Discord bot built with Google's DialogFlow and NodeJS to relay achievement data to my Hack The Box (hackthebox.eu/) team. It uses a combination of web scraping and API integration to connect team members with achievement data, rankings and machine and challenge details. Seven has a distinct personality and small talk subroutines; in fact, she makes naturally-occurring typos and has dynamic typing speed / status while responding (probably the coolest idea I've ever had in my life ðŸ˜€). 
Discord bot for HTB users.
