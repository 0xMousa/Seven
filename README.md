## About 
Seven is a semi-intelligent AI chatbot built with [DialogFlow](dialogflow.cloud.google.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), whose purpose is to make Hack The Box (hackthebox.eu/) achievement data accessible from Discord. 

## Capabilities
Seven can provide information about
  - her own functionality (try asking `help`, `what can you do for me`)
  - machines (active, retired and unreleased)
  `what machines / challenges did [username] do`
  - challenges
  - team members
  - team details
  - ownage (e.g. `who did [challenge name, machine name] [last?]`)
  - team global rank
  - team member leaderboard (top members)
## Examples:
Seven is super flexible and doesn't rely on templates or specific wordings to understand what users are asking for. However, here are some example queries:

## Privacy
Seven cares about privacy and allows channel users to:
- associate or disassociate their Discord ID to their HTB account ID (enabling this makes achievement information more useful as users may have different handles on each platform.
- disallow (or re-allow) inclusion of their HTB data in bot responses
## Installation and Usage
ðŸš§ This section will be completed soon! A few things have to be finished before Seven can be easily adopted by any team. 
## [PLANNED]: 
Some features that would make nice additions:
  - Offer advice / memory jogs from [RTFM](https://doc.lagout.org/rtfm-red-team-field-manual.pdf) for users LIKE: "stuck on **[STAGE** [*privesc, recon, persistence ...*]**]** with **[TECHNOLOGY** [*linux, nodejs, sql server ...*]**]**
 - Answer questions invoking possibly long data (while respecting Discord embed limitations):
 - "[teamname] members" (get member list, there are like 75 atm)
 - "machine list" (around 250 results, will default offer 20, ask user to confirm for another 20)
 - "all challenges" (same, around 150)
 - Give info on self based on Discord association
